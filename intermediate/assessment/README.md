# Introduction
This assignment is part of the Intermediate's training course for Front end developers. The problem statement is taken from an internal product that has been developed recently. The idea is to give you an understanding of the kind of designs you might be working on post your trainings while also focussing on the development process.

# Problem statement
Please refer to [this Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/Q6aTpSbBvnMskduSudcII2/Backoffice-navigation?node-id=272-38510&t=hmQGYRriqrAXVseY-0) or [this design](/intermediate/resources/designs/dashboard.png).

If you started off with Beginners training, then the designs must be already look familiar. So, as part of this assessment, 

## Summary of the design
- The designs are for a simple product-lookup webapp.
- A user can visit this page and look-up for any application available in the list.
- By default, the page shows all the available products.
- On clicking any of the products, the user will be taken to a new page having the details of the relevant app.
- The user can choose to bookmark his choice of app, that will be visible under "My Tools" as quick links for his next visit.

## Requirements
You must convert this design into a fully functional Single Page Application (SPA) that's supported by all the modern browser. Your application must exhibit the following:
- Responsive application
- Clicking on the logo on the navbar should navigate the user to https://frontiersin.org
- Filtering based on product names only
- Clicking on the products opens up the details on the same page.
- Bookmark should be functional
- Users should be able to view their bookmarked applications once they refresh the page

On top of this, you can let your creative juices flow for making the user experience even smoother.

## Resources
The assets/ resources required for the assignment are available [here](/intermediate/resources/).

## Process
- The solution has to be submitted in form of a Git repository.
- Every feature must be developed in a separate _feature_ branch.
- Once a feature is developed, a Pull/ Merge request to the _development_ branch must be created.
- Please mark "Anna Ricci Benson" as the reviewer.
- Merge your development into _main_ branch of your repository once your application is ready to be shipped.

## Checkpoints
Assignment-checkpoints have been created to help enforce proper hands-on learning. These checkpoints mark milestones at which you are expected to be fully capable to implement certain concepts independently.
### Checkpoint 1:
*Skills*: NodeJS, NPM, TS
*Expectation*: To have an understanding on how to create NodeJS APIs and create server to render application in conjunction with TS. These APIs are very basic ones, that require know-how of JS more than anything. The application should be consuming these APIs instead of the static JSON.
Resources:
  [APIs](/intermediate/resources/API.md)

### Checkpoint 2:
Skills: Vue3, Vite
Expectation: The application should now be completely transformed into a SPA (Single Page Application) using Vue3. All functionalities should be working as expected and state managed properly.
