# Introduction
This assignment is part of the Beginner's training course for Front end developers. The problem statement is taken from an internal product that has been developed recently. The idea is to give you an understanding of the kind of designs you might be working on post your training while also focussing on the development process.

# Problem statement
Please refer to [this Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/Q6aTpSbBvnMskduSudcII2/Backoffice-navigation?node-id=272-38510&t=hmQGYRriqrAXVseY-0) or [this design](/beginners/resources/designs/dashboard.png).

## Summary of the design
- The designs are for a simple product-lookup webapp.
- A user can visit this page and look-up for any application available in the list.
- By default, the page shows all the available products.
- On clicking any of the products, the user will be taken to a new page having the details of the relevant app.
- The user can choose to bookmark his choice of app, that will be visible under "My Tools" as quick links for his next visit.

## Requirements
You must convert this design into an HTML solution that can run on any modern browser. Your application must exhibit the following:
- Adjusting the UI as per the device/ screen size (responsive design)
- Clicking on the logo on the navbar should navigate the user to https://frontiersin.org
- Filtering based on product names only
- Clicking on the products opens up the details in a new tab.
- Bookmark should be functional 
- Users should be able to view their bookmarked applications once they refresh the page (Hint: use localstorage)

On top of this, you can let your creative juices flow and add animations or transitions to make the user experience more appealing.

## Resources
The assets/ resources required for the assignment are available [here](/beginners/resources/).

## Process
- The solution has to be submitted in form of a Git repository.
- Every feature must be developed in a separate _feature_ branch.
- Once a feature is developed, a Pull/ Merge request to the _development_ branch must be created.
- Please mark "Anna Ricci Benson" as the reviewer.
- Merge your development into _main_ branch of your repository once your application is ready to be shipped.

## Checkpoints
Assignment-checkpoints have been created to help enforce proper hands-on learning. These checkpoints mark milestones at which you are expected to be fully capable to implement certain concepts independently.
### Checkpoint 1:
Skills: HTML5/CSS3.  
Expectation: To have created a completely responsive layout for the assignment.  
Resources:
  [Dashboard](/beginners/resources/designs/dashboard.png).  
  [Dashboard (mobile)](/beginners/resources/designs/dashboard-mobile.png)

### Checkpoint 2:
Skills: JS.  
Expectation: The layout should now support interactivity. The products listing should be dynamic. The search by name should be functional, and segments tabs functional. Users should also be able to un/bookmark applications.
